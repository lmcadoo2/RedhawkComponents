# RedhawkComponents

These components are for use with the liquid-dsp library developed by Joseph Gaeddert.

In time I will attach a license to these files.

The liquid library that these compile for can be found at lmcadoo2/liquid-dsp.

PLEASE NOTE: Some versions of liquid downloaded will not compile with these components. For best results, use lmcadoo2/liquid-dsp
